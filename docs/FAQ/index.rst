Why does h5serv use those long ids?
------------------------------------

h5serv uses the UUID standard (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)
to identify objects (datasets, groups, and committed datatypes) uniquely.  The benefit of
using UUIDs is that objects can be uniquely identified without requiring any central 
coordination.

How can I get a dataset (or group) via a pathname?
--------------------------------------------------

You will need to iterate through the path to get the UUID of each subgroup.
E.g. suppose the path of interest is "/g1/g1.1" in the domain: "tall.data.hdfgroup.org".
Perform these actions to get the UUID of the group at /g1/g1.1.

#. ``GET /``  // returns the UUID of the root group
#. ``GET /groups/<root_uuid>/links/g1``  // returns the UUID of the group at "/g1"
#. ``GET /groups/<g1_uuid>/links/g1.1``  // returns the UUID of the group at "/g1/g1.1'

How do I guard against an attribute (dataset/group/file) from being deleted by a request?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future releases of h5serv will support authorization and permissions to protect content
that shouldn't be altered.

For now the choices are:

#. Don't expose the h5serv endpoint on a non-trusted network
#. Make the files readonly
#. Make periodic backups of all data files
#. Don't share the domain name with non-trusted sources.  Since h5serv doesn't provide an operation to list all domains on the server, creating a non-trivial domain name (e.g. "mydata_18494") will be relatively secure.

How can I display my data in a nice Web UI?
-------------------------------------------
There are many Javascript libraries (e.g. http://d3js.org) that can take the data 
returned by h5serv to create compelling graphics.  

I have a C or Fortran application that uses HDF5, how can I take advantage of h5serv?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are planning on creating a hdf5 library plugin that will transparently invoke the 
REST api.  For now, you can use C-libraries such as libcurl to invoke h5serv requests.

Is there documentation on the JSON format generated by h5tojson.py:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  There is a grammer published here: http://hdf5-json.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html. 

How do I submit a bug report?
------------------------------
If you have a Github account, create an issue here: 
https://github.com/HDFGroup/h5serv/issues.

Alternatively, you send a email to the HDF Group help desk: help@hdfgroup.org.
